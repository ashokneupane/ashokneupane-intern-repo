## Step 1: Duplicate this repository (including the issues)

By the end of this process, you will:
- Understand how to manage repositories on GitHub.
- Learn how to use issues, labels, and milestones for tracking progress.
- Gain hands-on experience with Node.js scripts and API automation.

Your first assignment is to **duplicate this repository** into a new public repo where you will track your progress.

## ‚úÖ **How to Duplicate This Repository**
Follow these steps carefully to set up your own intern repository.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Public Repository**
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Click on **New Repository**.
3. Name it something like `your-username-intern-repo`.
4. **Set it to Public** (so we can review it).
5. **Initialize with a README and MIT License**.
6. Copy the new repository URL.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a GitHub Personal Access Token**
To allow the script to create issues, labels, and milestones, you need to generate a **fine-grained personal access token**.

#### **Steps to Generate a Token:**
1. Go to **[GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer Settings ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)**.
2. Click on **"Generate new token (fine-grained)"**.
3. Call it something like "Clone Focus Bear onboarding repo"
4. Set the following **permissions**:
   - **Repository Access:** Select **"Select repositories"** and choose **only your new repository**.

- **Script not running?**
  - Run `node -v` to check if Node.js is installed.
