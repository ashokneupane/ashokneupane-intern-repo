# Git Basics
I am currently using git version 2.43.0.

I have used Git before, as I have worked on several web projects in a team. In such circumstances, while working at the same time, we used Git for pulling, pushing, and merging the code. 

In addition, I have used git for these several reasons

1. Keeping track of changes in the code.
2. Creating and working on different branches.
3. Resolving merge conflicts and reviewing pull requests.
4. Using it for backup and synchronization.

So, I have a basic understanding of Git.

I prefer to use the Git in VS Code as we don't need to switch between two window.

The interesting thing about git is that i like the hard reset command, which i have been used today.<br>
`git reset --hard <SOME-COMMIT>`
