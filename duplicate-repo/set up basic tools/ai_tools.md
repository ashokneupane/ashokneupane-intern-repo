# AI Tools
I tried ChatGPT. 
As i have used ChatGPT from long time especially for getting ideas, generating and debugging code. 

## What worked well
1. Great for explaining the programming concepts.
2. Can provide insight in any topic of any programming language.
3. Can debug the code if there are any issue in the code.
4. Can explain the code snippets line by line, which helps to understand the concept of any programming language.

## What didn't work well
1. Can give slightly incorrect explaination if the question is ambigious.
2. No AI tools can replaces official docs.
3. Spending most of the time in the AI tools helps to reduce our creativity and brainstroming power.

## When AI is most useful for coding
1. Help in brainstroming the ideas.
2. Document the code, which make the development work fast.
3. Help to understand the difficult code
4. Help to debug the code.
