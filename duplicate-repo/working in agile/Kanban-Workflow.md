# Agile Workflows & Kanban

## Kanban Board
Kanban board is a visual tool that helps to manage the task and track the work through different stages. It works by breaking work into individual tasks, each represented by a card, and organizing them into columns based on their status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).

## How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
1. Visualizes work so everyone sees what's being done and what's next.
2. By limiting work in progress(WIP) helps to increase productivity and focus on single task at a time.
3. set priorities by ordering tasks in the "To Do" Column or at the first row of To Do Column.
4. Allow flexibility to shift priorities without disrupting progress.
5. if a column start to fill up, it creates a bottleneck which can be avoided by pausing starting new work and focus on clearing struck tasks.


## How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
1. Prioritizing work by arranging tasks by importance.
2. provide clear visual representation of what task need to be done, what's in progress, and what's finished.
3. By limiting work in progress(WIP) avoid overloading of the tasks.
4. Monitoring flow to spot bottlenecks early and fix them quickly.
5. Reviewing regularly to reflect on whatâ€™s working and improve continuously.
