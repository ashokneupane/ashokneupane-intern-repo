# Roles in an Agile Team

## What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
**My role is developer**<br><br>
I contribute to the Agile process by the following ways:<br>
1. By working on the task assigned by the project manager.
2. By moving the task from To Do to progress to done for review.
3. By writing the clean, maintable and quality code.
4. By supporting continous delivery and improvement.
5. By collobration with other roles like project manager, QA, stakeholders and designer.
6. By building and deliver features based on the user stories.

## How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
I work closely with other roles and team by delivering the high-quality software and keep the workflow smooth.<br>
As a developer, my work overlap or interact with other roles in the team by:<br><br>
**1. With Product Owners:** I help clarify the user stories, give technical input, and estimate effort<br>
**2. With Designers:** I collobrate with them to convert the design into the functional features.<br>
**3. With QA:** I help them by writing the testable code and fix the bug identify by them.<br>
**4. With Other Developers:** I collobrate with them to write a functional code and pair them in dividing the work.<br>
**5. With Scrum Masters/Team Leads:** I communicate blockers and help improve team processes.

## Collobrate frequently with QA/Tester
I frequently collaborate with the QA/Tester to ensure the delivery of a high-quality project. I write clean, testable code—implementing both unit and feature testing—to make their testing process smoother and more efficient. The QA team then tests the application and identifies any bugs or issues. Once they report the findings, I work closely with them to resolve the problems promptly, contributing to a stable and error-free final product.
