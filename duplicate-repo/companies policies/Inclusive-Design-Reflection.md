# Working with Vulnerable Populations

## How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?
1. Being direct and clear in communication and avoiding ambiguity, idioms, and sarcasm.
2. By giving advance notice for changes and meetings and allow time for mental preparation and reduces stress.
3. By adopting written communication instead of verbal communication.
4. By giving some time to expect the response - not expecting immediate answers in conversations.

## What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?
1. Making the things more overstimulating and ambiguity to understand by using complex interface.
2. Unclear goals or feedback make users lost.
3. Unpredicatable reminders and notification that pop up without context or regularity can disrupt focus.

## What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?
I will use the plain language to make more people can access, understand, and benefit from our work, especially to support people having language barriers or low literacy.
