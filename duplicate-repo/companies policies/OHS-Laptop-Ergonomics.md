# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work
## What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? 
1. Using a laptop stand or monitor raiser help to raise the laptop screen to eye level in order to reduces neck and back strain from looking down.
2. Using an ergonomic chair help to support lower back and promotes upright posture.
3. Using a external keyword and mouse help to allows proper arm and wrist alignment preventing wrist strain and repetitive stress injuries(RSI).

## What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?
1. Taking a short break at regular interval of time like every 30 min.
2. Make a regular habit to sit upright with good posture.
3. Monitor/Laptop screen should be adjusted in a such a way that your eye should be at the same level or just below the monitor screen.

## How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?
1. Using the Focus Bear app to remind myself to take microbreaks every 20â€“25 minutes for deep breathing, stretching, and drinking water.
2. Check your posture during breaks or right after finishing tasks.

## One workplace change or habit adjustment you made.
I will commit to use the ergonomic chair in order to maintain good posture and support lower back.
