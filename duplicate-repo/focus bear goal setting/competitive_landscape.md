Focus Bear is designed for neurodivergent individuals, especially those with ADHD and Autism (AuDHD), and it goes beyond traditional focus apps by actively locking devices until habits are completed. Compared to Freedom and Cold Turkey, it not only blocks distractions but also guides users through routines. Unlike Tiimo, which is more of a visual planner, Focus Bear offers habit tracking, focus coaching, and AI-powered distraction control across all devices.

## Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
Currently, deactivating or pausing the app requires going through multiple steps, which can be time-consuming. It would be much more efficient if this process could be simplified to a single tap—ideally through a dedicated "Deactivate" button on the phone interface.
