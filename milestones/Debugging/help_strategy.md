## When AI is helpful in coding?
1. Generates boilerplate code and repetitive patterns quickly.
2. Assists with debugging by explaining errors.
3. Provides learning support and simplifies documentation.
4. Increases productivity with quick code snippets and suggestions.
5. Offers code review and refactoring tips.

## When AI isnot helpful in coding?
1. Struggles with complex, domain-specific business logic.
2. May not write performance-optimized or low-level code.
3. Can produce insecure code if used for authentication or encryption.
4. Might give outdated or incorrect information for new/rare libraries.
5. Over-reliance can hinder deeper learning and problem-solving skills.

## When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?
### Use AI when:
1. You need explanations or code examples in plain language.
2. You're exploring ideas or want quick prototyping help.
3. You want a guided, conversational approach.
### Use Google when:
1. You're looking for official documentation or error messages.
2. You need multiple sources to compare.
3. You're troubleshooting a well-known issue.

## How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?
1. When the problem involves project-specific or sensitive information.
2. If AI or Google didn’t help after initial research.
3. When it's a high-impact decision (e.g., architecture, performance).
4. For team conventions, best practices, or historical context.
5. When you're blocked and need a faster, reliable answer.

## What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?
**Tunnel vision** – Hard to spot obvious mistakes in your own code.<br>
**Lack of perspective** – May miss alternative or better approaches.<br>
**Wasted time** – Can spend hours stuck on solvable problems.<br>
**Overlooking team standards** – May implement fixes that clash with project norms.<br>
**Missed learning opportunities** – Collaboration can lead to faster growth.<br>
