## When should you use Redux instead of useState?

### useState
**1. Simple Components:** If your component’s state is self-contained and doesn’t need to be shared across other components, useState is the way to go.<br>
**2. Quick and Easy:** For small projects or individual features, useState keeps things simple and efficient.<br>
**3. Limited State Needs:** When you don’t need to manage a lot of state, useState works perfectly without adding unnecessary complexity.<br>

### Redux
**1. Complex Apps:** If your app is large or has a lot of state to manage, Redux helps keep things organized.<br>
**2. Shared State:** When you need to share the same state between many components, Redux makes it easy to keep everything in sync.<br>
**3. Predictable State:** Redux’s structure makes state changes predictable, which is great for debugging and scaling your app.<br>
