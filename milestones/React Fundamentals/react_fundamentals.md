## What challenges did you face during setup?
I didn’t face any major challenges during the setup of React with Tailwind CSS. However, while adding the Tailwind directives in the `index.css` file, I encountered a warning:
**Unknown at rule @tailwind css(unknownAtRules)**.

After some investigation, I realized that this was just a VS Code warning—not an actual error. It didn’t affect the functionality, and Tailwind CSS worked as expected. The warning was related to VS Code’s CSS language server not recognizing Tailwind-specific `@tailwind` directives.
