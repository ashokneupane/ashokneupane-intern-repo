# Working with Vulnerable Populations

## How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?
1. Being direct and clear in communication and avoiding ambiguity, idioms, and sarcasm.
2. By giving advance notice for changes and meetings and allow time for mental preparation and reduces stress.
3. By adopting written communication instead of verbal communication.
4. By giving some time to expect the response - not expecting immediate answers in conversations.

## What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?
1. Making the things more overstimulating and ambiguity to understand by using complex interface.
2. Unclear goals or feedback make users lost.
3. Unpredicatable reminders and notification that pop up without context or regularity can disrupt focus.

## What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?
I will use the plain language to make more people can access, understand, and benefit from our work, especially to support people having language barriers or low literacy.

## First-Person Account Review
I read a moving story shared anonymously by a young adult through Orygen’s Youth Advisory Council during Neurodiversity Celebration Week 2024. 

The author shared their journey of being diagnosed with both ADHD and autism in adulthood after a childhood filled with confusion, punishment, and emotional distress. They explained how misunderstood behaviors like stimming — self-stimulating actions such as hand-flapping or rocking — were punished or labeled as “bad,” causing them to internalize shame and suppress their emotions. The story highlighted how damaging it can be when neurodivergent experiences are not supported or recognized, and how life-changing it was to finally receive a diagnosis and language to understand themselves.

**What I learned:** Many neurodivergent individuals spend years masking their traits and struggling with internalized ableism due to stigma and misunderstanding. Emotional regulation, sensory processing, and the need for flexible coping strategies are essential considerations in inclusive design — especially in productivity tools, which often push rigid expectations.

## Focus Bear Improvement Suggestion
Add a **"Neuroaffirming Mode"** with:
1. Calmer colors and softer reminders
2. Flexible task timers
3. Optional visual breaks for emotional regulation
4. Supportive language like “Take your time”

This helps reduce pressure and sensory overwhelm.
