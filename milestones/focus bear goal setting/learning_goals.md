# Set your learning goals
## What do you hope to learn from this internship?
As this internship is for a Frontend Developer role and primarily focused on frontend work, I’m excited about the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of React. I'm particularly interested in learning how large-scale projects are structured and managed using React. My goal is to gain hands-on experience and a strong understanding of React by the time I complete the internship.<br>

In addition to technical skills, I’m also eager to learn about the company’s working culture—how team members communicate, how different roles collaborate to solve problems, and how projects are delivered. <br>

By the end of the internship, I hope to be fully qualified for a frontend development role, especially in React, and I would love the opportunity to continue working with the company in a full-time position.

## What skills are you most excited to develop?
As I mentioned earlier, on the technical side, I’m eager to strengthen my frontend development skills, particularly in React. I want to learn how to build and maintain large-scale, scalable applications and gain practical experience with intermediate to advanced React concepts. Beyond technical growth, I also want to improve my communication skills, especially verbal communication, to express my ideas more clearly and collaborate effectively. Additionally, I aim to enhance my teamwork skills by learning how to work closely with different roles in the organization, including backend developers, designers, QA engineers, and project/product managers. I believe this holistic development will help me grow into a well-rounded frontend developer.

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?
As I have some experience in a developer role, I believe I can contribute to the project and team through my technical skills, such as using Git for version control and writing clean, maintainable code.<br>

In addition, I can support the team by completing assigned tasks on time, ensuring I meet the deadlines set by the project manager. I’m also committed to actively participating in daily stand-up meetings and keeping the team updated on my progress, which helps maintain transparency and collaboration within the team.

## What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
One area I’m particularly eager to improve is my verbal communication skills. I currently feel less confident with spoken communication, but I believe I can strengthen this skill by actively participating in daily stand-up meetings, where I can regularly share updates on my tasks. I also plan to improve by communicating and collaborating with team members, asking for and receiving feedback, and engaging in one-on-one conversations. These strategies will help me gradually build confidence and become more effective in oral communication within a professional environment.

## What does success in this internship look like for you?
Success in this internship means gaining hands-on experience with React, learning how to work on scalable frontend projects, and improving my verbal communication and teamwork skills. By the end, I hope to feel confident as a job-ready React developer and contribute meaningfully to the team, with the potential to continue working with the company.
