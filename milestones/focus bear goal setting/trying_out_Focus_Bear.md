At first, I found the installation and setup a bit more difficult as it contains a lot of things to setup. But, After using it and some guidance and research, I found it easy to use and understand later.
## If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?
Focus bear is a productive app as it not only avoid the distraction from unproductive app but also encourges for healthy habits like doing exercice, medication, yoga and various others morning routine.
## What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?
Currently, deactivating or pausing the app requires going through multiple steps, which can be time-consuming. It would be much more efficient if this process could be simplified to a single tap—ideally through a dedicated "Deactivate" button on the phone interface.

### Screenshot #2
**Area:** All UI screens of the Focus Bear desktop app<br>
**Problem:** When I click the minimize button (-) on the Focus Bear app, it minimizes correctly. However, if I try to minimize it by clicking outside the app, switching to another app, or using Alt+Tab, the Focus Bear window does not minimize.<br>
**Actual Behavior:** The app remains open on the screen instead of minimizing to the taskbar when clicking outside, switching apps, or using Alt+Tab.<br>
**Why It's Unclear:** New users may find this behavior frustrating or annoying because it is not consistent with typical desktop app behavior.<br>
**Suggestion:** The app should automatically minimize to the taskbar when clicking outside the window, switching to another app, or using Alt+Tab.<br>

### Screenshot #3
**Area:** While using the app on desktop<br>
**Problem:** Too many pop-ups appear while trying to focus on work, making it difficult to stay concentrated. Users should be given some uninterrupted time while working on important tasks.<br>
**Actual Behavior:** A large number of pop-ups are generated during usage, even while focusing.<br>
**Why It's Unclear:** Users may find it confusing and frustrating to be constantly interrupted, which negatively impacts productivity.<br>
**Suggestion:** Implement a strategy to minimize the number of pop-ups during focus sessions, allowing users to work with fewer distractions.<br>

### Screenshot #4
**Area:** Onboarding Experience<br>
**Problem:** New users may find the app overwhelming due to numerous features and the absence of a guided introduction.<br>
**Suggestion:** Implement a beginner-friendly onboarding tour to help users understand key functionalities and navigate the app more effectively.<br>

### Screenshot #5
**Area:** Habits tab on the Focus Bear mobile app.<br>
**Problem:** Difficulty locating the "Stop Blocking Distractions" button.<br>
**Actual Behavior:** The button is not immediately visible, making it challenging to find.<br>
**Why It's Unclear:** After initiating a focus mode, it took approximately five minutes to locate the option to stop blocking distractions, leading to confusion.<br>
**Suggestion:** Enhance the visibility of the "Stop Blocking Distractions" button by placing it in a more prominent location or adding clear labels to guide users​.<br>
