# Implementing Internationalization with i18next #19

### What challenges did you face while setting up i18next?
**Incorrect hook usage:** Like calling `useTranslation()` outside a component.
**Missing or invalid JSON:** Translation files must be perfectly formatted.
**File path issues:** When using `i18next-http-backend`, incorrect file placement or URL mapping can break loading.
**Language not switching:** Often due to forgetting `i18n.changeLanguage()` or caching issues.
**Fallback not working:** If `fallbackLng` isn't configured properly.

### Why is it important to use a library like i18next instead of manually handling translations?
1. Organized resource management (JSON files).
2. Runtime language switching.
3. Pluralization, interpolation ({{name}}), and context handling.
4. Built-in fallbacks and browser language detection.
5. Support for async loading and namespaces.

### How would you handle dynamic content (e.g., user-generated text) in a multilingual app?
If the app allows multilingual content creation (like user-posted articles), consider:

1. Storing translations per content: e.g., store title_en, title_es, etc., in database.
2. Using third-party translation APIs: e.g., Google Translate or DeepL for auto-translations.
3. Flagging untranslated content: Let users know when content is not available in their selected language.

This can be done using i18next:<br>
`t('posted_by', { username: comment.user })`

And define it in the translation:<br>
`"posted_by": "Posted by {{username}}"`
